The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Following are the instructions,

1. Download data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the data downloaded and the save in the directory from which your R is set to work.
3. Load and run the [run_analysis.R] (https://github.com/SajjadY/Getting-And-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script, after the execution has finished you will see that a new created file called data_for_submission.txt

## Dependencies :

The R script assumes you have 'data.table' installed using install.packages("data.table")
